## Introduction

This project is designed to explore extensive arbitrage opportunities by leveraging price differentials in both cryptocurrency and forex markets. The main areas of focus are:
- **Cross-Exchange Arbitrage**: Identifying price discrepancies for the same asset across different cryptocurrency exchanges.
- **Cryptocurrency Triangular Arbitrage**: Exploring arbitrage within a single exchange using a triangle of three different cryptocurrencies.
- **Forex Triangular Arbitrage**: Applying triangular arbitrage methods to the forex market to capitalize on currency conversion cycles.
- **Data Utilization**: Demonstrating the use of real-time exchange data and efficient data processing techniques in Python to identify and evaluate arbitrage opportunities.

The project aims to quantify the frequency and profitability of these arbitrage opportunities and showcase the application of financial APIs and Python in complex financial analyses.

## Features


- **Real-time Data Fetching:** Pull live cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API.
- **Arbitrage Detection:** Algorithmically detect arbitrage opportunities based on fetched prices.
- **Visualization:** Generate and display potential arbitrage paths and their profitability.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Track and log arbitrage opportunities over time.

## Results

### Key Insights
- **Effective Detection**: Successfully identifies triangular and cross-market arbitrage opportunities using the Bellman-Ford algorithm and graph theory.
- **Adaptability**: Initially designed for triangular arbitrage, adaptable for cross-market scenarios with further modifications.
- **Real-time Application**: Demonstrates potential for applying theoretical tools in real-time trading environments to exploit fleeting arbitrage opportunities.

### Limitations
- **Execution Speed**: Requires rapid execution to capitalize on fleeting arbitrage opportunities, which can be hindered by data latency and processing delays.
- **Transaction Costs**: High transaction fees can significantly impact profitability, especially when multiple transactions are needed to complete arbitrage cycles.
- **Market Volatility**: Assumptions about static exchange rates do not hold in volatile markets, and sufficient market liquidity is crucial for executing trades effectively.
- **Practical Application**: Effective real-world application demands careful consideration of operational realities and market conditions.
